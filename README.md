# Project 3 (ViewsAndModifiers)

This is my solution to the ViewsAndModifiers project (project 1) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It includes the first challenge presented at the end of the project. The other two challenges are implemented as updates to [project 1](https://github.com/bgilmour/project01-100days-WeSplit/tree/v1.1-project.3) and [project 2](https://github.com/bgilmour/project02-100days-GuessTheFlag/tree/v1.1-project.3).
